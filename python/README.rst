CosmicFish_pylib
================

This is a Python library that allows to manipulate, rearrange and get useful information out of a precomputed Fisher matrix.

1. Requirements:
================

Currently the Python library uses many other libraries and in particular::

    matplotlib
    numpy
    scipy
    math
    sys
    os
    itertools
    copy

Make sure you have these libraries installed in your machine to fully exploit this software.
We warmly suggest to install a bundled package like (https://www.continuum.io/downloads).

2. Applications:
================

The library comes with a set of already made applications that can be used and can be found in the folder apps.

3. Extensive documentation:
===========================

This library has a separate documentation that can be found at:

http://cosmicfish.github.io/documentation/CosmicFishPyLib/index.html


4. How to:
==========

**Add an application**: to add an application that exploits the CosmicFish python library just code it following the style of the ones already present in the apps folder.
Then add it to the list in COSMICFISH_DIR/documentation/python/cosmicfish_pylib_apps.rst to make sure that it is included in the documentation.
