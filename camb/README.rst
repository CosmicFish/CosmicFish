CosmicFish: camb folder
=======================

The CosmicFish library uses camb (http://camb.info) based codes to compute cosmological predictions.

In particular the CosmicFish code is compiled against

* CAMB (http://camb.info)
* EFTCAMB (http://eftcamb.org)
* MGCAMB (http://icosmology.info/MGCAMB.html)

If you use the CosmicFish code, built with one of these three codes, to obtain your scientific results please cite the relevant references in addition to the CosmicFish ones.
