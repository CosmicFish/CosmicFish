Branches
=============================

The master branch contains latest changes to the main release version.

CAMB_sources is the updated public `CAMB Sources <http://camb.info/sources/>`_ code.

The vehre_formatted branch is a developement version, which integrates CAMB and CAMB sources, and uses Fortran 2008 (and hence requires gfortran 6).
This branch also has an integrated test suite, which runs on Travis automatically for new commits.
