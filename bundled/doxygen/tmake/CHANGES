		     Changes from version 1.2 to 1.3

* Improved Qt 2.0 support.

* INCLUDEPATH can have directories containing whitespace (use semicolon)
  as separator.

		     Changes from version 1.1 to 1.2

* tmake is no longer restricted to C++ only.  You can now use both C++
  and C files in your project.  Thanks to Ulrich Ring for valuable feed-
  back and comments.

* Added support for building DLL libraries under Windows.
  NOTE: Qt 1.42 and later now uses qtmain.lib in addition to qt.lib
  when your application uses the Qt DLL.  Add "DEFINES = QT_DLL" to
  your project file to use the Qt DLL.

* New dist target added in the app and lib templates.
  Run "make dist" to pack all files in your project using tar/gzip or zip.
  Thanks to Kalle Dalheimer for this patch.
