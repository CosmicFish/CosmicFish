Bug reports have to be sent to the address
<ivprimi(at)libero(dot)it> . Please, put Numdiff
in the subject and indicate the version of the operating system you
are running (in particular, do not forget to specify if
it is a 32- or a 64-bit system), and, if you know it, 
the version of the compiler used to build Numdiff.
Please write also whether your version of Numdiff uses the
GNU MP library or not.
Before writing an email be sure to run the latest
stable version of Numdiff, I do not provide
support for older versions.

Known issues 
============

If you use gcc 4.7.2 or clang 3.3 to compile and build Numdiff (but other
versions of these compilers could also be affected by this issue), do not run 
"configure" with "--enable-optimization" and do not set the environment 
variable CFLAGS to -O, -O1, -O2, etc., unless you also use "--disable-gmp". 
If you enable the optimized build of the code while keeping GMP-based 
multiple precision arithmetic active, then the executable of Numdiff you get
will not run properly (long execution time with overloading of the processor).
