.PP
Compare putatively similar files line by line and field by field,
ignoring small numeric differences or/and different numeric formats.
.PP
RANGE, RANGE1 and RANGE2 stay for a positive integer value or
for a range of integer values, like 1\-, 3\-5 or \fB\-7\fR.
The two arguments after the options are the names of the files to compare.
The complete paths of the files should be given,
a directory name is not accepted.
The given paths cannot refer to the same file
but one of them can be "\-", which refers to stdin.
.PP
Exit status: 1 if files differ, 0 if they are equal, \fB\-1\fR (255) in case of error
.PP
\fB\-s\fR, \fB\-\-separators\fR=\fIIFS\fR
.IP
Specify the set of characters to use as delimiters
while splitting the input lines into fields
(The default set of delimiters is space, tab and newline).
If IFS is prefixed with 1: or 2: then use the given delimiter set
only for the lines from the first or the second file respectively
.PP
\fB\-D\fR, \fB\-\-delimiters\fR=\fIDELIMS\fR
.IP
Specify the set of strings to use as delimiters
while splitting the input lines into fields
(The default set of delimiters is space, tab and newline).
If DELIMS is prefixed with 1: or 2: then use the given delimiter set
only for the lines from the first or the second file respectively
.PP
\fB\-a\fR, \fB\-\-absolute\-tolerance\fR=\fITHRVAL[\fR:RANGE|:RANGE1:RANGE2]
.IP
Set to THRVAL the maximum absolute difference permitted
before that two numeric fields are regarded as different
(The default value is zero).
If a RANGE is given, use the specified
threshold only when comparing fields whose positions lie in RANGE.
If both RANGE1 and RANGE2 are given and have the same length,
then use the specified threshold when comparing a field of FILE1
lying in RANGE1 with the corresponding field of FILE2 in RANGE2
.PP
\fB\-r\fR, \fB\-\-relative\-tolerance\fR=\fITHRVAL[\fR:RANGE|:RANGE1:RANGE2]
.IP
Set to THRVAL the maximum relative difference permitted
before that two numeric fields are regarded as different
(The default value is zero).
If a RANGE is given, use the specified
threshold only when comparing fields whose positions lie in RANGE.
If both RANGE1 and RANGE2 are given and have the same length,
then use the specified threshold when comparing a field of FILE1
lying in RANGE1 with the corresponding field of FILE2 in RANGE2
.PP

.IP
Consider two numerical values as equal only if
both absolute and relative difference do not exceed
the corresponding tolerance threshold
.PP
\fB\-F\fR, \fB\-\-formula\fR=\fINUM\fR
.IP
Use the formula indicated by NUM to compute the relative errors.

the values in FILE2 as sample values.
