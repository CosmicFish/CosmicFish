CosmicFish: apps
===============

This folder contains the source code for the CosmicFish applications.
All the .f90 source code present in this folder will be compiled against the CosmicFish library for all different Boltzmann solvers.
The resulting binaries can be found in the build directory in the bin folder of the desired Boltzmann code.

Writing your own app should be straightforward taking the already implemented ones as an example.

The documentation for the implemented applications can be found in the fortran documentation at http://cosmicfish.github.io/documentation/CosmicFish/index.html.
