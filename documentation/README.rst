CosmicFish: documentation
========================

This folder contains the documentation for the CosmicFish code.

1. doxygen:
===========

The folder doxygen contains the code to build the automatic documentation of the Fortran part of the library.

We use doxygen (http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/) to build this part of the documentation.

If you want to contribute to the development of CosmicFish writing some part of Fortran code please consider adding your comments in a format that is automatically readable by doxygen.

2. python:
==========

The folder python contains the relevant code to build the automatic documentation of the python part of the library.

We use sphinx (http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/stable/) to build this part of the documentation.

If you want to contribute to the development of CosmicFish writing some part of the python code please consider adding your comments in a format that is automatically readable by sphinx. In addition you might need to add the necessary ionformations to the sphinx files in the documentation/python folder.
