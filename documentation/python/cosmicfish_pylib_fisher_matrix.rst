cosmicfish_pylib.fisher_matrix
------------------------------

.. currentmodule:: cosmicfish_pylib.fisher_matrix

Module that contains the fisher_matrix class and the operations defined on it.
The idea is that of creating a Fisher matrix safely, with all operations being
well defined and safe-guarded once the input matrix is accepted as a Fisher matrix.
